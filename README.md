# HEART_FAILURE_PREDICTION
Heart failure is a significant consequence of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), which are the leading cause of death globally. In this study, we aim to predict mortality from heart failure using clinical data. The dataset contains 12 features and a target variable indicating whether the patient experienced a "death event" during a follow-up period. Early detection and management of individuals at high risk of heart failure can be facilitated by machine learning models. The primary objective is to develop a Bayesian Network model and other machine learning models that identifies relationships between key clinical features and mortality.

We generated synthetic data as a part of this project. The purpose of generating synthetic data was to maximize our dataset, as initially the dataset size was only 300. After the synthetic Data generation, we concatenate both datasets to yield a dataset of size 600.
